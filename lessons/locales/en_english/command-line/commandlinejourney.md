# Command Line Journey

## Journey Content

This Journey helps you to understand how to navigate the file system using command line commands. Using these commands, you can navigate through directories, examine files, as well as view their
properties such as owner, size, and permissions.  You will be able to view the contents of files and read them if they are human-readable.  This Journey is broken down into several
sections:

* Reading Files and Directories
* Creating, Deleting, Moving and Copying Files and Directories
* Getting Help
* Advanced Topics

## Try/Practice/Test

As you work through the Journey, you will see a Linux system on the side panel of the page where you can try the commands. When you have completed learning the commands in each sections, you will find a "... practice" page that will give you some tasks to complete on a Linux system.

When you are confident with these commands, you can complete the Journey Test and receive a digital badge that you can use to communicate your competence with these skills.
