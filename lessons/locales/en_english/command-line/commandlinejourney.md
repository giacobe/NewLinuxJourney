# Command Line Journey

## Journey Content

This Journey helps you to understand how to navigate the file system using command line commands. Using these commands, you can navigate through directories, examine files, as well as view their properties such as owner, size, and permissions.  You will be able to view the contents of files and read them if they are human-readable.  This Journey is broken down into several sections that you will see on the menu on the left of the screen. This Journey has four sections.

* Reading Files and Directories
* Creating, Deleting, Moving and Copying Files and Directories
* Getting Help
* Advanced Topics

## Try/Practice/Test

Try: As you work your way through the Journey, you will see a Linux system on the side panel of the page where you can try the commands.

Practice: When you have completed learning the commands in each section, you will find a "... practice" page that will give you some tasks to complete on a Linux system. The "...practice" page is designed to help you learn the commands, apply them in context, and build your Linux muscle memory. 

Test: When you are confident with the commands and the "... practice" page exercises, you can complete the Journey Test to receive a digital badge that you can use to communicate your competence with these skills.
