# Journey Content

This Journey helps you to understand how to input and output text through the Linux command line. This Journey has three sections. Files may have a lot of textual data in them, especially log files. You may wish to examine large amounts of textual data, but only find, locate, and display the specific lines that have the data you want. The commands in this Journey will help you with line-level text manipulation.

    stdin, stdout, stderr
    cut, paste, head, tail, tr
    grep, sort, uniq, wc, nl
    join, split, (un)expand

Try/Practice/Test

Try: As you work your way through the Journey, you will see a Linux system on the side panel of the page where you can try the commands.

Practice: When you have completed learning the commands in each section, you will find a “… practice” page that will give you some tasks to complete on a Linux system. The “…practice” page is designed to help you learn the commands, apply them in context, and build your Linux muscle memory.

Test: When you are confident with the commands and the “… practice” page exercises, you can complete the Journey Test to receive a digital badge that you can use to communicate your competence with these skills.
