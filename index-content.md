# Welcome to the New Linux Journey

This site is a port of the original LinuxJourney.com.  We have added some additional content, re-arranged some of the content, and we have added execises for you to practice what you are learning. Each section of this site is a "Journey" that we expect you to complete.  Each subsection of a Journey has several pages. Each page has a practice Linux machine that you can try what you're learning. Each sub-section has a "...practice" section where you can repeat again and again until you get the hang of the concepts in the sub-section. Finally, each Journey has a "Final Exam". This test will help you to prove that you are confident and familiar with the commands, methods, and tools presented in that Journey.  Those who complete the Journey's Exam are offered a digital badge to show your individual successful completion.
